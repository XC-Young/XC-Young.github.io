<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a frist-year PhD student in the [LIESMARS](https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My advisors are Prof. [Bisheng Yang](https://3s.whu.edu.cn/info/1025/1415.htm) and Prof. [Zhen Dong](https://dongzhenwhu.github.io/index.html).  Previously, I obtained my B.Eng degree at [SGG](http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/) of Wuhan University.

My research interest lies in the field of point cloud intelligent processing, particularly including point cloud registration. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me at <yangxc@whu.edu.cn>!

I am a member of [WHU-USI3DV](https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV), please check advancements on point cloud processing including enhancement, registration, localization, segmentation, detection, etc.
